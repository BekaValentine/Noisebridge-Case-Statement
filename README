## How to compile LaTeX

This report is compiled with XeLaTeX or LuaTex.

If you would like to compile it on the web, you can use ShareLaTeX: https://www.sharelatex.com/

If you would like to compile it on your own computer, these setup instructions from UPenn are pretty good: https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis160/current/files/resources/latex_setup_guide.pdf

## Notes on image ownership (Edits TODO)

* The 'sky.jpg' picture is from my personal gallery. Please do not use it without my permission. 
* The 'logo.png' picture is The Glider - The Hacker Emblem.
